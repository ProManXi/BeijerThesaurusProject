# Webapp - Thesaurus Dictionary

This is a web application built using **ASP.NET Core MVC** and **JavaScript/jQuery**.

---

## ✨ Requirements

The Thesaurus Dictionary application was built to fulfill the following features:

### 📚 Add Word with Synonyms
- Users can add a word along with multiple synonyms.
- Validation ensures only alphabetic values are accepted.
- Duplicate entries are prevented.

### 🔍 Search for Synonyms
- Users can input a word and get its complete synonym chain using a graph-based traversal (DFS).

### 📜 View All Words
- Users can view a list of all added words in the system.

## 🔗 Endpoints

| Endpoint            | Description                                     |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `/`                 | Main UI to add words, view all, and search      |
| `/api/thesaurus/addword` | API to add new word and its synonyms         |
| `/api/thesaurus/getsynonyms?word={word}` | API to get synonyms for a word  |
| `/api/thesaurus/getallwords` | API to fetch all words in the thesaurus  |

---

## 💾 Persistence

- Words and their synonym mappings are persisted in a **JSON file**.
- The file path is configurable through `appsettings.json`.

```json
"thesdata": {
  "filepath": "data/thesaurus.json"
}
```

```

- Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5000

## ✅ Running Unit Tests

- Project uses **xUnit** for unit testing
- Run the following command to execute tests:

```bash
dotnet test
```

- Ensure `LoggerService` and other dependencies are correctly mocked/injected in test setup.

---

## 🧪 Notes on Unit Tests

- Tests validate:
  - Input validation
  - Caching and file persistence
  - Graph traversal logic
- Uses in-memory mocks for `ICacheService`, `ILoggerService`, etc.

## 🧯 Troubleshooting

### Logging Not Working?
- Ensure `LoggerService` is correctly registered in `Program.cs`

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<ILoggerService, LoggerService>();
```

### Configuration Not Loaded?

```json
"thesdata": {
  "filepath": "data/thesaurus.json"
}
```
